## macOS

**Installing Sorrel on macOS**

Since **Sorrel** isn’t distributed through the Mac App Store, macOS will treat it as an app from an _unidentified developer_. Follow these steps to safely install and run Sorrel on your Mac:

---

### Step 1: Download Sorrel

1. Visit the [download page](/download) and download the latest `.dmg` file.
2. Once the download is complete, open the `.dmg` file.

---

### Step 2: Move Sorrel to Applications

1. In the window that appears, drag the **Sorrel** icon into the **Applications** folder.
2. Close the installer window and eject the disk image (right-click on it and choose **Eject**).

### Step 3: Open Sorrel for the First Time

Because Sorrel is from an _unidentified developer_, you’ll need to manually approve it:

1. Open **Finder** and navigate to **Applications**.
2. Locate **Sorrel**, then **right-click (or Control-click)** the icon and choose **Open**.
3. A security prompt will appear. Click **Open** to confirm.

> 💡 You only need to do this once. Future launches will work as normal.

If macOS blocks the app without showing the “Open” option, you can override it in:

**System Settings > Privacy & Security**
→ Scroll down to **Security**
→ Click **“Open Anyway”** next to Sorrel.
