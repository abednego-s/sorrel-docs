title: Managing Workspaces
---

Sorrel allows you to manage multiple **workspaces**, making it easy to separate and organize your writing projects.

---

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** in Sorrel is like a self-contained project area—each with its own notes and folders.
This is (almost) similar to what apps like _Obsidian_ call a **Vault**.

Workspaces are ideal for keeping your work organized across different themes, clients, or creative projects.

## Creating a New Workspace

To create a new workspace:

1. Click the **Home** icon in the left sidebar to go to the home screen.
2. In the **Create a new workspace** section, type a name for your new workspace.
3. Click **Create**.

Your new workspace will be added and opened immediately.
